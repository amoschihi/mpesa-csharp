# Mpesa.Net ðŸ’¸
> An Mpesa Library for .Net

## Introduction to M-Pesa
M-Pesa is one of the most popular mobile money platform praised by the even the likes of Bill Gates.
M-Pesa runs on STK so it should ideally run on any phone.
Safaricom released a Rest API called [Daraja](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke)
Before getting started with this lib please create an app on Daraja Sandbox

## Preface
- All Daraja APIs are included in this library and are well documented and even these docs are generated from code comments
- Unit tests are included
- This library does not include a callback server. You will have to write your own. Checkout [this repo (Express.js)](https://github.com/safaricom/mpesa_listener) to see how to receive callbacks.
- This documentation is written by unix users. This should not be a problem for Windows users, all commands should still run.
