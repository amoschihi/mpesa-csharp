We recommend using Nuget. Current version: ![](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Mpesa.Net.svg?style=flat-square)
```sh
$ dotnet add package Mpesa.Net --version {current version}
```
That should be it ! Lets get writing code

## Development
This section is for those who want to hack this library. Ideally you should be ok.
