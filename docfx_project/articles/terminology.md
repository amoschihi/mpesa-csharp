# Mpesa Terminology

![Mpesa Terminology](https://media.giphy.com/media/122kVpDEBF1pWE/giphy-downsized.gif)

Since a lot of developers are working on M-Pesa outside Kenya, we thought it would be good to describe some terminology for those interested!

- *M-Pesa*: The mobile money platform
- *Paybill*: A unique 6-digit code used for bill payment eg electricity. Usually has a transaction fee.
- *Till Number*: A unique 6-digit code used for purchasing goods or services. Usually has no transaction fee.
- *STK*: SIM Tool Kit. (That menu that comes with a SIM card)
- *Daraja*: Means Bridge, Usually used to refer to the [developer site](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke)
- *LNM*: Means _Lipa na M-Pesa_ meaning Pay with Mpesa. These transactions are always triggered programatically.
- *B2B*: denotes transactions between two business/shortcodes.
- *C2B*: denotes transactions started by user.
- *C2BSimulate*: Since C2B transactions are always started by the user. This denotes the mocking of user triggering the transaction.

Feel free to improve this on Github!
